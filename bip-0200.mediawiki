Welcome, friend! These Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT) documents describe a layer-2 protocol for off-chain bitcoin transfer by mutual cooperation, relying on on-chain transactions for enforcement if necessary.

Some requirements are subtle; we have tried to highlight motivations and reasoning behind the results you see here. I'm sure we've fallen short: if you find any part confusing, or wrong, please contact us and help us improve.

This is version 0.

== Glossary and Terminology Guide ==

* ''Funding Transaction'':
* The on-chain, irreversible transaction which pays to both peers on a channel. Thus it can only be spent by mutual consent.
* ''Channel'':
* A fast, off-chain method of mutual exchange between two ''peers''. To move funds, they exchange signatures for an updated ''commitment transaction''.
* ''Commitment Transaction'':
* A transaction which spends the funding transaction; each peer holds a signature from the other peer for this transaction, so it always has a commitment transaction it can spend. After a new commitment transaction is negotiated, the old one is ''revoked''.
* ''HTLC'': Hashed Time Locked Contract.
* A conditional payment between two peers: the recipient can spend the payment by presenting its signature and a ''payment preimage'', otherwise the payer can cancel the contract by spending it after a given time. These are implemented as outputs from the ''commitment transaction''.
* ''Payment hash, payment preimage'':
* The HTLC contains the payment hash, which is the hash of the payment preimage. Only the final recipient knows the payment preimage; thus when it reveals the preimage to collect funds is considered proof that it received the payment.
* ''Commitment revocation key'':
* Every ''commitment transaction'' has a unique ''commitment revocation key'' value which allows the other peer to spend all outputs immediately: revealing this key is how old commitment transactions are revoked. To do this, each output refers to the commitment revocation pubkey.
* ''Per-commitment secret'':
* Every commitment derives its keys from a ''per-commitment secret'', which is generated such that the series of per-commitment secrets for all previous commitments can be stored compactly.
* ''Mutual Close'':
* A cooperative close of a channel, by broadcasting an unconditional spend of the ''funding transaction'' with an output to each peer (unless one output is too small, and thus is not included).
* ''Unilateral Close'':
* An uncooperative close of a channel, by broadcasting a ''commitment transaction''. This transaction is larger (ie. less efficient) than a mutual close transaction, and the peer whose commitment is broadcast cannot access its own outputs for some previously-negotiated duration.
* ''Revoked Transaction Close'':
* An invalid close of the channel, by broadcasting a revoked ''commitment transaction''. Since the other peer knows the ''commitment revocation secret key'', it can create a ''penalty transaction''.
* ''Penalty Transaction'':
* A transaction which spends all outputs of a revoked commitment transaction, using the ''commitment revocation secret key''. A peer uses this if the other peer tries to &quot;cheat&quot; by broadcasting a revoked ''commitment transaction''.
* ''Commitment Number'':
* A 48-bit incrementing counter for each ''commitment transaction''; they are independent for each peer in the channel, and start at 0.
* ''It's ok to be odd'':
* A rule applied to some numeric fields that indicates optional and compulsory support for features. Even numbers indicate that both endpoints MUST support the feature in question, while odd numbers indicate that the feature MAY be disregarded by the other endpoint.

== Theme Song ==

<pre>  Why this network could be democratic...
  Numismatic...
  Cryptographic!
  Why it could be released Lightning!
  (Release Lightning!)


  We'll have some timelocked contracts with hashed pubkeys, oh yeah.
  (Keep talking, whoa keep talkin')
  We'll segregate the witness for trustless starts, oh yeah.
  (I'll get the money, I've got to get the money)
  With dynamic onion routes, they'll be shakin' in their boots;
  You know that's just the truth, we'll be scaling through the roof.
  Release Lightning!
  (Go, go, go, go; go, go, go, go, go, go)


  [Chorus:]
  Oh released Lightning, it's better than a debit card..
  (Release Lightning, go release Lightning!)
  With released Lightning, micropayments just ain't hard...
  (Release Lightning, go release Lightning!)
  Then kaboom: we'll hit the moon -- release Lightning!
  (Go, go, go, go; go, go, go, go, go, go)


  We'll have QR codes, and smartphone apps, oh yeah.
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo)
  P2P messaging, and passive incomes, oh yeah.
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo)
  Outsourced closure watch, gives me feelings in my crotch.
  You'll know it's not a brag when the repo gets a tag:
  Released Lightning.


  [Chorus]
  [Instrumental, ~1m10s]
  [Chorus]
  (Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning!
   Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning!)


  C'mon guys, let's get to work!</pre>
